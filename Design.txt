//Step 1: Declare Monster Variables
var m1
var m2
var m3


//Step 2: Questions 1-??

//have to make a button for all the questions which calls a function to all the if statements within the question 

//Question 1: I think we need to use <script> to make the questions 

//This is an example of the Button <button type="button" onclick="alert "Function call here">Click Me!</button>


//if example would be:
// Im not sure if its m1++ OR ++m1 but its either OR.

if (userSelection == 2 && SubmitButton == true/1) {
    m1++ OR ++m1 
}



Step 3: 

// Create a Submit button so we can talley the score and link to diff monster pages

//This is an example of the Button 

<button type="button" onclick="alert "Function call here">Click Me!</button>


//Function call here would need to link towards another page based on the highest tallied monster variable.




btn">
Step 4:


//Make the different monster pages.

//After we make a singular monster page we can copy paste and change each page to fit the different monsters.




if(m1  ) {
